## Introduction

The hackathon is designed to give you hands-on experience with:  
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** Utilising Neuphonic's API for Voice Synthesis.  
- **Speech-to-Speech (TTS):** Utilising Neuphonic's API for Conversational AI

In what follows, we'll show you how to get started and use our software!

---

## Setup

### Prerequisites

You will need to be running a minimum of Python 3.10+ 

You'll also need to get an API Key, which you can get from beta.neuphonic.com.

### Installation

Clone the repository:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/neuphonic/ucl_hackathon.git
cd ucl_hackathon
```

Create a virtual environment and install the dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Code Overview

### Text-to-Speech (TTS)

The **Text-to-Speech** module leverages Neuphonic’s API for generating high-quality audio.

**Key Functionality:**  
- `neuphonic_tts(input_text)`: Converts input text into speech and plays it.

Test this out with

```python
python neuphonic_texttospeech.py
```



### Speech-To-Speech (STS)
We've also created a file called neuphonic_speech_to_speech.py which allows you to talk to a module in a speech to speech fashion. It's connected to a Deepgram ASR, OpenAI LLM, and then the Neuphonic TTS. By installing pyneuphonic, you install all the depencies required to get it up and running.

1. Speak into the microphone, and the system will transcribe your speech in real time.
2. The transcribed text is sent to the LLM to generate a response.
3. The response is converted to speech using the TTS module and played back to you.
4. Repeat the process to continue the conversation.


Test this out with

```bash
python neuphonic_speech_to_speech.py
```
